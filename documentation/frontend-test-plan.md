## 1. Scope and goals

**In scope**
- All routed pages and lazy-loaded views
- Auth0 login/logout and guarded routes
- Snippet CRUD, fork, favorite, comment, follow
- Collections create/open/delete/add/remove
- Editor layouts, save, unsaved-changes guard, full-page preview
- Assets upload/copy/delete (when MinIO enabled)
- Settings profile (including MinIO profile image when enabled) / editor preferences / account privacy / username / delete account
- Embed player (tabs, editable, theme query param)
- Server-side search (`q`) on lists and collections
- Shared UI: pill tabs, glass cards, dialogs, snackbars

**Out of scope**
- Backend unit/integration tests (see API / Postman docs)
- Load / performance benchmarking
- Cross-browser matrix beyond Chromium + one Safari/Firefox spot-check (extend if shipping publicly)

---

## 2. Prerequisites

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| Stack running | `docker compose up` (or prod stack) with `db`, `api`, `frontend` healthy |
| Auth0 | Callbacks/logout/web origins match the URL under test |
| Browser | Chromium latest; optional Safari / Firefox |
| Network | DevTools open for failing cases (Console + Network) |
| MinIO | Optional — run Assets section twice: enabled and disabled |

Confirm:

```bash
# Frontend reachable
curl -I http://localhost:4200   # or your tunnel / prod URL

# API health (path may vary by deploy)
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health || true
```

Record environment under test: URL, compose file (dev vs prod), MinIO on/off, Auth0 tenant.

---

## 3. Test accounts and data

Prepare at least:

| Account | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **User A** | Primary owner — create snippets, collections, assets |
| **User B** | Second user — follow, favorite, comment, fork A’s public work |
| Optional **User C** | Extra follow graph / privacy checks |

Seed data (as User A before deep regression):

- 2+ public snippets (different names/descriptions/tags)
- 1 private snippet
- 1 collection with 2+ pens
- 1 favorited public snippet from B (or favorite A’s own after B publishes)
- Enough items to exercise pagination (page size 6)

---

## 4. Pass / fail criteria

**Pass** when:

- Expected UI appears without console errors (except known third-party noise)
- API calls return expected status; UI reflects server state after refresh
- Destructive actions require confirmation and only run on confirm
- Snackbars show readable white text on glass pills; dialogs match card glass (no harsh double border)

**Fail** when:

- Blank/stale content after navigation (e.g. previous snippet still shown)
- Search only filters the current page (must hit server and update total)
- Confirm dialogs skipped; data deleted without confirmation
- Unsaved editor changes discarded without prompt

Mark each case: **Pass** / **Fail** / **Blocked** / **N/A**.

---

## 5. Smoke suite (must pass every release)

Run in order (~15–20 minutes).

| ID | Case | Expected |
|----|------|----------|
| S1 | Open landing → Log in | Auth0 → redirect `/home` |
| S2 | Create New Snippet | Editor opens; can type HTML/CSS/JS; preview updates |
| S3 | Save snippet | Snackbar success; dirty flag clears; reload keeps content |
| S4 | Set description + tags + public | Settings dialog saves; appears on Explore |
| S5 | Favorite from list | Heart fills; Favorites tab shows it without hard refresh |
| S6 | Fork (as User B) | New snippet owned by B; navigates to B’s editor |
| S7 | Comment | Post shows in dialog; count bumps |
| S8 | Create collection + add snippet | Appears under Collections; detail lists pens |
| S9 | Search on Explore | Debounced; totals/pagination from server |
| S10 | Log out | Returns to landing; guarded routes redirect to login |

If any smoke case fails, stop and fix before full regression.

---

## 6. Authentication and shell

| ID | Steps | Expected |
|----|-------|----------|
| A1 | Visit `/` logged out | Landing header with Log in and View snippets; no Your Snippets / Following |
| A2 | Visit `/home` logged out | Auth0 redirect / login |
| A3 | Login success | `/home`; feed nav + user avatar menu |
| A4 | Refresh on `/home` | Session restored; user header populates (not stuck empty) |
| A5 | User menu → Home / Profile / New Snippet / Assets / Settings / Log out | Each route/action works |
| A6 | Log out | Session cleared; `/home` requires login again |

---

## 7. Landing page

| ID | Steps | Expected |
|----|-------|----------|
| L1 | View hero | Brand “Snippy”, headline, CTAs, glass cards, atmosphere orbs |
| L2 | Log in CTA | Starts Auth0 |
| L2a | View snippets CTA / header Public | Navigates to `/public` without login |
| L3 | Explore Features / section anchors | Scrolls to features (if linked) |

## 20. Embed player

Requires a **public** saved snippet with a `shortId`.

| ID | Steps | Expected |
|----|-------|----------|
| EM1 | Open Embed dialog from editor | Preview iframe + copyable HTML; blocked if private/unsaved |
| EM1a | Narrow viewport | Dialog content scrolls; copy/theme controls remain reachable |
| EM2 | Select theme (e.g. Dracula) | Preview URL includes `theme=dracula`; code pane uses that theme |
| EM3 | Open `/embed/{shortId}?theme=light` | Light theme on code tabs |
| EM4 | Open with invalid `theme=nope` | Editor still loads; theme falls back (defaults / viewer prefs) |
| EM5 | `editable=true` | Local edits allowed; not persisted to snippet |
| EM6 | `default-tab=css,result` | CSS + Result panes shown |

---

## 21. Search (server-side)

For each surface below: type a query that matches an item **not on page 1** (or reduce page size), wait ~400ms debounce, verify Network call includes `q=...` and UI total updates.

| ID | Surface | Endpoint should include `q` |
|----|---------|------------------------------|
| SE1 | Home → Snippets | `GET /snippets/me?q=` |
| SE2 | Home → Collections | `GET /collections/me?q=` |
| SE3 | Home → Favorites | `GET /favorites?q=` |
| SE4 | Explore | `GET /snippets/public?q=` (or search) |
| SE5 | Following | `GET /snippets/feed?q=` |
| SE6 | Profile pens | `GET /snippets/user/:user?q=` |
| SE7 | Profile collections | `GET /collections/user/:user?q=` |
| SE8 | Collection detail pens | `GET /collections/:shortId?q=` |
| SE9 | Clear query | Restores unfiltered list |
| SE10 | No client-only trap | Matching item on another page is found |

Also verify empty query does not send useless search-only empty results.

---

## 22. Dialogs, snackbars, and glass UI

| ID | Steps | Expected |
|----|-------|----------|
| UI1 | Confirm dialogs (delete snippet/collection/comment/asset/account) | Shared layout; Cancel + destructive primary |

|----|-------|----------|
| G1 | Unsaved editor → browser back / nav link | Confirm guard fires |
| G2 | Saved editor → navigate | No confirm |
| G3 | Deep link `/:user/snippet/:id` while logged out | Login then land on snippet (or home per Auth0 config) |
| G4 | Invalid snippet id | Error / not-found state; no infinite spinner |
| G5 | Invalid collection id | Collection not found empty state |
| G6 | Unknown route | Redirects to landing |

---

| R2 | 768px / 1280px | Grid columns as designed |
| R3 | Keyboard | Tab through nav, dialogs, forms; Enter activates primary |
| R4 | Focus | Dialog focuses first control; Escape closes where Material allows |
| R5 | Contrast | White text on glass/snackbars readable on dark atmosphere |

---

## 25. Error and empty states

| ID | Steps | Expected |
|----|-------|----------|
| ER1 | API 500 on list load | Error messaging / empty list; no blank white screen |
| ER2 | Offline mid-save | Error snackbar; content remains dirty |
| ER3 | Empty favorites / collections / comments / assets | Icon + message (AsyncState pattern) |
| ER4 | Favorite API failure | Heart reverts; error snackbar |

---

## Appendix — DevTools checks

While testing search and lists, filter Network for:

- `/api/v1/snippets/me`
- `/api/v1/snippets/public`
- `/api/v1/snippets/feed`
- `/api/v1/snippets/user/`
- `/api/v1/favorites`
- `/api/v1/collections`

Confirm `q`, `page`, `limit`, and `sort` query params match UI state.

Console should stay free of Angular/Material errors during happy paths.
